## Obsolete Folders/Files 
Because of the long-term nature of this project and the fact that its grown and evolved so much over the years (C, C++, C#, flat-files, Lua, database, etc) there are numerous legacy files remaining in the structure.  For example, nearly every file in the /Data/ folder is obsolete but has been left in place for reference.  

## Documentation Files 
Some files within the /doc/ folder are also obsolete, from a day before the project was under source control.
