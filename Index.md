Based on SmaugFUSS 1.9 which was obtained from Nick Gammon's website (http://www.mushclient.com/downloads/dlsmaug.htm).

The goals of this project are:
  * Make the SmaugFUSS code easier to maintain for non-C developers
  * Organize and clean-up much of the codebase
  * Replaced out-dated code (list and string handling in particular) with .NET Library code or extensions
  * Replaced out-dated #defines and structs with class objects and enums
  * Use Windows sockets instead of the existing network layer
  * Replace file-handling with a more robust file handling system
  * Lastly, get the code back into working (and running) order
