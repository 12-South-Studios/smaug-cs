Alania Telkhat
(1st Visit)
Welcome to the Inn of the Seven Planes, stranger. I have not seen you around here before. Are you new to the city?
- Yes I am. My name is <Name>.
  - I am pleased to meet you, <FirstName>.
    - Link to below
- That is my own business. Leave me be.
  - Very well. Good day to you.

(After)
Good day to you, <FirstName>. What can I do for you?
- Who are you?
  - My name is Alania Telkhat of the Caorlei.
- What are you?
  - I am a healer by trade. I travel the lands healing those in need and offering my services to others for a price. Do you require healing?
- What are the Caorlei?
  - We are the Chosen of Maron, the sons and daughters of Melesa. We are of the Blood, the Kaerove, and are favored of Laisi.
    - Who is Maron?
      - Surely you jest, <FirstName>? I will indulge you this time.
        - Continue
          - Maron is the Creator of All, The One Light.
    - Who is Melesa?
      - The Healer, Mother and one of the Thirteen.
    - Who is Laisi?
      - The Teacher, Keeper of Knowledge and one of the Thirteen. 
    - What is the Kaerove?
      - It means "Blood" in my language and refers to the Caorlei, the Teralei, the Uralei, and even the Denorlei. Or what you would call elves and half-elves.
- What are you doing here?
  - I am passing through Dushara on my way east.
- Where can I find healing?
  - Well, right here, of course. I am a healer by trade and would be happy to heal you. For a small price.
    - Please heal me.
      - (if healnig required) Here you go, <FirstName>.
    - Nevermind
- (if quest 1 taken) What do you know of the undead?
  - I know enough. The undead began appearing only a few weeks ago from beneath the city. They have not yet reached the city streets, but unless something is done and soon they might. 
- (if son_quest taken) Have you seen Chalan's son?
  - Torval I believe his name was. I spoke with him three days ago, but have not seen him since. He asked me questions about the catacombs and the undead and I believe he meant to enter them himself. Brave, but foolish.
