0 SURVEY~
The survey command is used on the overland maps to scan your
surroundings for visible landmarks. You will get a rough
estimate of distance to the landmark, and its general direction
from where you are standing. Some landmarks will be more visible
than others. If you are within range of more than one landmark,
all of the ones you can see will be displayed.

Example:

To the north, in the near vicinity, a pitch black monolith rises toward the sky.
To the southeast, in the near vicinity, whisps of smoke rise up from a small cabin in the woods.

The above example is what you would see when surveying from the
intersection of the two trails near the hermit's cabin in the
Haon Dor Forest.

0 OVERLAND WILDERNESS 'ANSI MAP' 'ASCII MAP'~
<Your mud name here> now features an ANSI map which represents the
terrain features of the area between zones. There are 3 maps, one
for each of the 3 continents of the planet. Travelling on them is much
the same as wandering through an area, except that you can see several
spaces around you as you travel.

It looks something like this:

&w^^^^^^^^^
^&g*******&w^
^&g***&WX&g***&w^
^&g**&WX&R@&WX&g**&w^
^&g*******&w^
^&g*******&w^
^^^^^^^^^&z

Each of the colored symbols represents a different kind of terrain.
The &R@&z symbol is you, and the &WX&z symbols are exits off of the map, either
to other maps, or to regular zones such as Darkhaven. It is possible to
encounter random monsters roaming the map.

The map is best viewed with ANSI color turned on.
~

51 COORDS~
Syntax: coords <x> <y>

The coords command simply lets you jump to a new set of coordinates
on the overland map. All you need to do is type 'coords <x> <y>'
where x and y are the target coordinates on the map. Note that this
only moves you to new coordinates on the map you are currently on.
If you want to change maps, use the 'goto' command to accomplish this.

~

51 GOTO~
Syntax: goto map <mapname> [x] [y]
Syntax: goto <location>

If you are going to an overland map, type 'goto map <mapname> [x] [y]'
where mapname is the name you gave to the target map, x and y are the
target coordinates on that map. The x and y coordinates can be left out,
in which case you will be sent to the geographical center of that overland
map.

You can also specify a location. This location can be the vnum of a room,
a name of a mob, or a name of an object. 

If the location is a mob or object, you will be transported directly to
it weather it is in a normal room or on the overland.

If the location is a vnum, does not yet exist, you have an area assigned,
and the vnum is within your range, it will be created with default data 
so that the room can then be edited with the 'redit' command.
 
You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.

63 SETEXIT~
Syntax: setexit create
Syntax: setexit delete
Syntax: setexit <vnum>
Syntax: setexit map <mapname> <X-coord> <Y-coord>

The setexit command allows you to manipulate exits from the overland
to rooms or other maps. The command is fairly straightforward.

To create a new exit, simply type 'setexit create' while standing on
your overland map.

To delete an existing exit, simply type 'setexit delete' while standing
on the coordinates of the exit sector. You will probably need to use the
'coords' command to move onto the exit sector.

To set an exit from the map into a regular zone, type
'setexit <vnum>' where vnum is the target room's vnum.

To set an exit from one map to another map, type
'setexit map <mapname> <X> <Y>' where mapname is the name you gave to
the target map, x is the target x coordinate, and y is the target y
coordinate.

Any manipulation of an exit automatically saves the entrances.dat file
to disk, so there is no need to worry about saving that file.

63 MAPEDIT~
Syntax: mapedit
Syntax: mapedit sector <type>
Syntax: mapedit save <mapname>

The mapedit command is used to make changes to the overland map system.
It's a fairly involved portion of the OLC code as a whole, but is not
terribly difficult to use.

Typing 'mapedit' with no other arguments toggles your editor on or off.
When on, any movement you make will change the sector you're moving to
into whatever you have yourself set for. Think of it as "painting".

To set yourself to create a sector, simply type 'mapedit sector <type>' 
where the type is something from the sectortypes list. Also note that
while you are in edit mode, typing 'look' will cause the sector you are
in to be changed.

To save changes to a map, type 'mapedit save <mapname>'. If you leave out
the mapname, the map you are currently on will be the one saved.

For details on using the floodfill option, see 'help floodfill'.

For details on manipulating exits on the map, see 'help setexit'.

For details on manipulating landmarks on the map, see 'help setmark'.

63 SETMARK~
Syntax: setmark add
Syntax: setmark delete
Syntax: setmark desc <destription>
Syntax: setmark distance <distance>

Landmarks are the points on the overland maps that the survey command uses
to display its information to players. The data is stored in a simple text
file in the directory with the ANSI maps.

To add a landmark, go to the coordinates you want it to be at and simply
type: setmark add

To remove one, go to the coordinates it is at and simply type:
setmark delete

The description is just a short line of text to describe what the survey
command sees. When editing the description, keep it as short as possible,
do not capitalize words unless referring to names, and do not add punctuation
to the end of the line. To change the description, go to the landmark
coordinates and type: setmark desc <text>, Where <text> is the
description you want.

Distance is the number of spaces the landmark is visible from on the overland.
Try not to make the distance too large, or too small. Anything visible for
more than 50 or so spaces is most likely too large - unless the landmark is
intended to display a large geographical feature such as a mountain.

To see the existing list of landmarks and their locations, type: landmarks

63 FLOODFILL~
Syntax: mapedit fill <sectortype>
Syntax: mapedit undo

Floodfilling is the process of changing all of the terrain within a contained
section of the map into another kind of terrain. It operates much the same way
as Windows Paint, or any other floodfill function in a graphics editor would.

You will first need to use the mapedit command to walk an outline on the map
in the shape you'd like it to be. Once you've done this, turn off your mapedit
flag and then step to the inside of the area you've just surrounded ( or to
the outside if you want to fill what's on the outside instead ).
Then, type: mapedit fill <sectortype> where sectortype is any sector in the
sectortypes list, except exits. The floodfill function will the proceed to 
change everything inside the boundry from what your standing on, into what you 
want it to be.

So if your standing on oceans, and you want to fill grassland inside the boundry,
type: mapedit fill grassland. That will change all the oceans into grasslands.

Note that you CANNOT specify a terrain type to fill in that is the same as what
you are standing on. To force the code to allow for that would create an infinite
loop, and so the fill operation will just fail instead.

If for some reason you need to undo what you've just filled in, simply type:
'mapedit undo' and your last floodfill will be reversed.

53 REDIT~
Syntax: redit <field> [parameter list]
        redit on
 
FIELD   | PARAMETERS             -- DESCRIPTION / NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
name    | <room name>            -- sets the room name / short description
exit    | <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keywords]
bexit   | same as above, but does the exit in both directions
desc    | none                   -- you will be placed into the buffer editor
exdesc  | <direction> [text]     -- sets/clears an exit's description
ed      | <keyword(s)>           -- adds/edits an extra description to the room
rmed    | <keyword(s)>           -- removes an extra description from the room
sector  | <value>                -- sets the sector type
flags   | <flag> [flag]          -- toggles room flags
exflags | <direction> [flags]    -- displays/toggles exit flags
exname  | <direction> [keywords] -- sets an exit's keywords
exkey   | <direction> <key vnum> -- sets an exit's key vnum/value
excoord | <direction> <x> <y>    -- sets an exit's coordinates onto a map

Note: When setting exit coordinates, be sure the exit is flagged "overland"
      or it will not work. The exit will lead out to whichever map covers
      the continent the area is on.

Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.
 
REDIT ON will lock you into a mode in which 'redit' is implied in each command
sequence, and hitting enter will give you an instant rstat of whichever room
you are in at the time. To get out of REDIT ON, simply type the word DONE.
Example:
 
        redit on
        name A dark and forboding hallway
        flags dark indoors
        done
