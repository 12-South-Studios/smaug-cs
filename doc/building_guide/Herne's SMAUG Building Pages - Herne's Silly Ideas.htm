        <p class="Text_Main">Okay... I've been chewing on a few ideas lately and 
          I thought it might be time to share them with the rest of you. I would 
          warn you first though, most of these ideas would require some coding. 
          But before you make that "Oh no! Not Coding!"-face, please 
          take the time to read them.</p>
        <p class="HeadB"><a name="SP"></a>Starting Points</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">A good, baseline "World" map. As things 
          are now, areas are generally just plunked down hither and yon with little 
          or no thought of how one area relates to the next. As an example, you 
          can walk out the east gate of DH to New Thalos and you're in a desert, 
          while at the same time, if you walk out the south gate of DH and follow 
          the river west, you're suddenly in a frozen wasteland. Seems a bit silly, 
          doesn't it? I tried to lay out a generalized map of the world and I 
          did the best I could in relating all the current areas (not including 
          those that supposedly exist in another "plane", ie: Astral 
          Plane, Galaxy, etc) in a logical manner. Sure, each "room" 
          isn't the same size when we're looking at an area, but it would be nice 
          to relate things so that a "frozen waste" doesn't overlap 
          onto "the great eastern desert"... If we could agree on a 
          baseline, then we could use that map as a tool for implementing new 
          areas and not have everything clustered within a dozen or so rooms of 
          DH.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">When starting a new MUD, or planning to revise an 
          existing MUD, I'd suggest that you lay down a good baseline map and 
          insist that all the new areas be placed where they fit best, rather 
          than just plunking them down. Areas should fit their location and environment 
          too!</p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="HT"></a>Hometowns </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">When Witherin mentioned this idea to me, I thought 
          it would be great to have several "base" towns that PC's could 
          adventure from rather than having to always return to DarkHaven. </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">On another MUD I tried when I was first experimenting 
          in the "mud world", I found that they had started out with 
          a "baseline world". They even gave you a map when you started 
          off, albeit a very general ASCII map, but it was enough to know that 
          you were in Town A and if you wanted to get to Town B you had to go 
          generally northeast from Town A, or whatever. They also had it set up 
          so that new players would start out in different towns, although I don't 
          know if it was random or not, and as you progressed you could choose 
          your recall point by going to a special mob. If we added a "recall 
          vnum" to the pfile, we could customize a player's recall point 
          and we could also mset it when we wanted to change it.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">PlayerA may begin his life in TownA, but he may join 
          a Guild in TownB when he reaches 20th level and his recall point will 
          be changed when he joins the Guild. Then somewhere down the line he 
          discovers TownC, and wishes not to recall to the Guildhall in TownB, 
          but to recall to the Guildhall in TownC ... Once again, mset his recall 
          vnum and now he recalls to the Guildhall in TownC.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">How would we change the recall vnum? MPMSET or a 
          version of it... Modify the induction code to automatically mset the 
          player's recall to the default Guildhall (probably in DH)... And if 
          a player wanted to recall to TownC, he would have to physically WALK 
          to TownC and find the mob/guildmaster there that could mpmset him.</p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="GODS"></a>Deities </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Witherin did a great job of setting up the original 
          pantheon for RoD. A whole system of Greater Gods, Lesser Gods and Minor 
          Gods... Everything from "The god of Goodness" to "the 
          god of Thieves". EVERY god doesn't need to bestow something on 
          a PC that worships him/her/it, but it makes great steps towards role-play 
          if every player can have some kind of deity to worship and occasionally 
          call upon when they run into trouble. A big problem we faced in the 
          beginning was that players were given too much to begin with (in regards 
          to deities) and then resented the fact that we had to downplay some 
          of the god's powers in the interest of "game balance". It's 
          so easy to go overboard, but it's a real pain to have to backpedal... 
          Starting off small is a much better way.</p>

          were too cold? (Ok, I'm dreaming now, but still...)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Moon phases — The phase of the moon could probably 
          be linked to the calendar, or it would be better if the moon ran on 
          it's own cycle much like in RL. Maybe some spells would work better 
          when the moon was full?</p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="HOUSE"></a>Mortal Housing</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">I've kicked the idea of Mortal Housing around in 
          my head, and I came up with a couple of solutions that might work.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">First, add 2 more settable vnums to a Mortal's pfile. 
          The first vnum would be his "house number" and the second 
          vnum would be his "guest number", this eliminates the need 
          for keys and their possible loss due to crash, DT, etc.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Second, code a roomflag called "house" 
          (or "home"), and use that flag to add "noastral", 
          "noportal", "nomob" flags to a vnum. Basically, 
          you want to add all those flags in one-shot. Only the owner of a house, 
          or his invited guest should be able to enter the house, uninvited guests 
          should receive some sort of message that they're unwanted or uninvited.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Next, you set aside a block of say 1000 vnums, depending 
          on the size of the MUD, and designate them as "dwelling" vnums.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The whole idea is; A mortal can purchase, with glory 
          or cash, a "house" of say 1-room and add all descriptions 
          and stuff that he wants with the help of an Immortal. The Mortal is 
          then say, "homeset" to the vnum of that room. That vnum would 
          be stored in the pfile as "home", and only a person with that 
          vnum could gain access to that specific room.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">So now a person wants to have guests in their home, 
          fine — add an "invite" and "uninvite" command. 
          Invite would allow another person to enter the home of the person doing 
          the inviting, uninvite would force the person to leave or remove their 
          access to a home. Syntax; invite (person) or uninvite (person). Uninvite 
          should work even if the person is not currently in the home, and if 
          they are already in the home, it should send the person back to his 
          or her recall point.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Finally, I suggest that a person would lose their 
          "guest" status whenever they log-out of the MUD, this would 
          stop guests from abusing another person's home when they weren't around. 
          Also, I think it would probably be a bad idea if a home's contents were 
          saved (as donation rooms are saved) as this leaves the MUD open to abuse. 
          A much better idea would be to use a locker-type code as some other 
          MUDs already do.</p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="TERRAIN"></a>Extending Terrain</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">This idea is probably fairly code-heavy, I could 
          be wrong...</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">How many times have you entered a new area and thought 
          to yourself how easy it was to wander around. Afterall, usually there 
          are only a few paths you can take, some leading to danger and others 
          leading to your goals. Wouldn't it be nice if you could travel "off 
          the beaten path" and go from point A to point C without having 
          to pass through point B on the way? That's where the idea of a "Random 
          Terrain Generator" comes in.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Generating random terrain could be an extension of 
          the current "Exdistance" code, except that the "terrain 
          file" would be area specific. When a player chose to wander off 
          of the path built for him, the terrain generator would kick in and construct 
          rooms on the fly using descriptions from the area-specific file. It 
          might be a good idea to allow a build to specify limits to how far a 
          player could travel in one direction, though.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">A more simplistic approach might be a change to the 
          exdist code to allow for area-specific random description generation, 
          although this might take up more disk space than is comfortable.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Wouldn't it be nice to use Ultima-style travelling 
          within a MUD? Simply wandering across country rather than being stuck 
          to set pathways between areas would be a treat. </p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="MAGMOBS"></a>Magistrate Mobs </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">(This idea has been partially implemented on Rod 
          already and available in the newest versions of SMAUG as far as I know.)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The basic idea is to make a mob that will deal with 
          (THIEF), (ATTACKER), and (KILLER) flags [maybe even (LITTERBUG) for 
          fun]. Supporting code needed for this idea would be: MPBRAND, MPPARDON, 
          and an 'ifflaged' ifcheck.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The scenario is; Player steals from mob, mob catches 
          player stealing, mob would MPBRAND Player as (Thief). Being branded 
          as a thief, a player would be refused service at all shops (I think 
          the coding for this is already present). Player, wanting to remove his 
          Thief flag, goes to the Magistrate mob. Magistrate would have a program 
          to check Player's flag [ifflagged($n) == THIEF], the mob would then 
          say something like; "Player, you have been branded a thief. If 
          your plea is guilty, then your fine is 2 million coins, otherwise begone 
          from my sight!" Player would then have the option of paying 2 million 
          coins and the mob would "MPPARDON (Player) thief", or player 
          could go without shops.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Similarly, someone flagged as (ATTACKER) [Although 
          I prefer "RUFFIAN"] would have to seek the Magistrate for 
          a pardon, and probably pay more than someone flagged THIEF. Perhaps 
          anyone flagged RUFFIAN would be refused service at "healing" 
          mobs because of his/her shady past. Being flagged as a KILLER would 
          require a huge fine, or maybe even jail time to have the flag removed. 
          And lastly, a LITTERBUG flag could be added to add a bit of "fun" 
          to things... A janitor mob who sees you dropping trashes might MPBRAND 
          you as a LITTERBUG and you'd be required to pay a small fine to have 
          it removed.</p>

        <p class="Text_Main">(This idea has been implemented in the newest version 
          of SMAUG.)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">I'm suggesting a change be made to the way resists 
          and immunities are handled. Rather than a resist or immune being simply 
          a yes/no kind of check, perhaps resists could be coded as a percentage. 
          An IMMUNE would simply be 100% resistance, while a RESIST would be 50% 
          resistance. This would allow builders to make finer changes to armors/weapons 
          so that a "suit of platemail" doesn't simply make one immune_pierce, 
          but merely something like 'resistant to pierce by 75%'. Being resistant 
          by 75% would mean that any damage done by a pierce would be reduced 
          by 75%. This, combined with layering, would allow for a better selection 
          of armoring... One could wear a suit of plate with padding underneath 
          and have a 'resist pierce by 40%' and 'resist blunt by 10%'.</p>

          Dexterity.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The idea is, if a warrior wishes to "invoke" 
          one of his skills, s/he must expend a number of MPs in order to be successful.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Some suggested skills, you ask? Well how about a 
          "Kindred Strength"-like skill which increases a warrior's

          increase the amount of damage a warrior could take in a battle? A "Valiance"-type

          "Truesight"-like skill that would increase a warriors resistance

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="CLASSES"></a>Ideas for New Classes</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">While flipping through my RoleMaster™ books, 
          I read over some of the possible character classes and thought some 
          of them might be useful for us in making new classes. As Blodkai states; 
          "The problem with making new classes is that the old classes already 
          share so many things that it's hard to make something completely new." 
          What we need to do is to make NEW skills and spells, some based on the 
          old ones, and some totally new and limited to specific classes. In my 
          opinion, each class should have at least ONE spell/skill that makes 
          it unique.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Here's a list of some of the classes (professions) 
          in RoleMaster™;</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>The Realm of Arms</b>; Your basic hack &amp; slay 
          artists. FIGHTER (your basic Warrior), THIEF (your basic Thief), ROGUE 
          (a Warrior /Thief), BURGLAR (an acrobatic thief), WARRIOR MONK (a Warrior 
          that specializes in unarmed combat and martial arts), BARBARIAN (a warrior 
          that uses very little armor), and a CAVALIER (a fighter that follows 
          a specific code of ethics and serves a lord).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>The Realm of Essence</b>; Pure spell users that 
          draw on universal "mana". MAGICIAN (an elemental-type spellcaster), 
          ILLUSIONIST (a spellcaster that specializes in misdirection and confusion), 
          ALCHEMIST (a spell- caster that manipulates physical matter), and a 
          RUNEMASTER (specializes in power gained from runes, glyphs, wards, circles 
          and Power words).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>The Realm of Channeling</b>; Pure spell users 
          that get power from "above". CLERIC (spellcasters than channel 
          power from their deities), ANIMIST (very Druid-like, they specialize 
          in studying living things, both animal and vegetable), HEALER (spellcasters 
          that specialize in healing, taking the injuries into themselves, then 
          healing themselves slowly), and a SHAMAN (whose power is manifested 
          through spirits and nature).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>The Realm of Mentalism</b>; Pure spell users that 
          draw power from "within". MENTALIST (their spells come from 
          the power of the mind), LAY HEALER (their spells aid others in healing 
          wounds/diseases), and a SEER (their spells mostly deal with gathering 
          information).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Combinations of Two Realms of Magic</b>; Hybrid 
          spell users. SORCERER (combines Essence and Channeling, concentrating 
          on spells of destruction), MYSTIC (combines Essence and Mentalism, concentrating 
          on misdirection and modification), ASTROLOGER (combines Channeling and 
          Mentalism, concentrating on information gathering and detection), ARCHMAGE 
          (a spell-caster who can draw on all 3 types of magic), and NECROMANCER 
          (hybrid of Channeling and Essence, specializing in summoning communing 
          with, and control of the dead), and a WITCH (hybrid of Chan- neling 
          and Essence, drawing power from deity(s) and demon(s), specializing 
          in conjuring and nature-type magics).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Combinations of Arms and Magic</b>; Use spells 
          to augment their weaponskills. MONK (semi spell-casters who specialize 
          in unarmed combat), RANGER (very much like our Ranger with spells meant 
          to control the outdoors and weather), BARD (semi-mentalists who specialize 
          in spells of lore, sound and item use), PALADIN (an "Arthurian" 
          Knight that has healing spells), NIGHTBLADE (an assassin with spells 
          of illusion and distraction), DELVER (a semi-spell users with spells 
          dealing mostly with elements and item construction), and a BEASTMASTER 
          (a semi-spell user that has an affinity for animals and can bind them 
          to his service).</p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="SKILLS"></a>Suggestions for New Skills</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">This is a mix of things from my own head, and things 
          drawn from other sources that I have on hand. I've seen a couple variations 
          of these already implemented on other MUDs, but don't go screaming that 
          I copied them, I didn't.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">(Some of these ideas have been implemented in the 
          newest version of Realms of Despair.)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Forage</b>: A skill for gathering food from the 
          surrounding environment. Player would have to be a an "outdoor"-type 
          sector, and would be able to find 6-12 kinds of food objects (roots, 
          insects, fungus). Maybe this can be combined with the search for spell 
          components for new Druid and Ranger spells?</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Camouflage</b>: A skill that can be used for hiding 
          objects. It would simply add a (Hidden) flag to an object, much like 
          "dig" adds the (Buried) flag and would require a "search" 
          to uncover.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Awareness</b>: A skill that would function like 
          a "detect hide" and "detect sneak".</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Ambush</b>: The ability to make a very precise 
          "backstab"-like attack upon an unsuspecting opponent while 
          the attacker is sneaking (or stalking) and hidden. Stalk: Much like 
          "sneak", but is "target-specific", ie: stalk deer.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Trap-Building</b>: This would probably be very 
          difficult to accomplish, but the general idea would be the skill to 
          take several components and construct a 1-shot trap with a specific 
          type of trigger attached to it. This idea could be too ambitious.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Directional Sense</b>: A skill something like 
          "Track" that would give you an idea of where you've been rather 
          than where you're going. The most basic skill would allow you to always 
          have a "feeling" of where "home" was, while a more 
          advanced application would allow a player to specify an "anchor" 
          point and always know where that was in relation to their current position.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Enchant Armor</b>: Permanently add an enchantment 
          to non-magical armor. Would function something like "Enchant Weapon".</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Etch Rune</b>: Would allow the user to etch their 
          weapon with a 1-shot weaponspell, that would invoke on a successful 
          "to hit". Has a chance of damaging/destroying the weapon when 
          cast.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Concoct Poultice</b>: A skill used to make a salve 
          that will confer a specific spell to a player that applies it. Would 
          require some sort of material component to make the concoction and perhaps 
          fire. (A good Druid skill)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Blur</b>: A spell that will "blur" the 
          caster's outline, thereby making them harder to hit.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Fear</b>: A spell, that when successfully cast 
          will lower the victim's HR and DR slightly, and also has a chance of 
          causing the target to "flee in terror". Courage: A spell that 
          would give a resistance to the above "Fear" spell.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Battle Cry</b>: A spell/skill that temporarily 
          confuses and demoralizes a foe in battle. Perhaps it would invoke a 
          temporary deduction to a mob's/foe's HR and DR.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Earthmight</b>: Spell that transforms the caster's 
          body to resemble that of a troll, taking on increased size, strength, 
          and physical abilities. Would function something like "stoneskin", 
          "trollish vigour", increase the user's DR, and lower user's 
          charisma, int, wisdom and HR.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>EarthCloak</b>: Makes casters undetectable by 
          sight, sound, or smell. Would function something like "sneak", 
          "hide" and "invis" and only work in the outdoors.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Homonculous</b>: A spell a mage could use to invoke 
          or create a familiar "demon". Spell would require a material 
          component, perhaps a "mandrake root" or the like, and fire. 
          The strength of the familiar would be based on the mage's level.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Druidstaff</b>: A spell which would invoke a "staff" 
          object for druids, which depending on the level of the caster, would 
          have certain magical affects. A material component(s) would be required.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Barkskin</b>: A spell that causes the caster's 
          skin to take on a rough bark-like form. Much like a lesser form of "stoneskin". 
          Nightvision: skill/spell that allows user to see in the dark as if it 
          were regular daylight.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Spider Climb</b>: A spell that allows caster to 
          climb a surface as if they had a climb skill of 100.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Body Weaponry</b>: A spell that hardens the caster's 
          hands and feet so that the caster can fight unarmed but do damage as 
          if he was holding a weapon.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Mountain Heart</b>: Allows user to absorb more 
          damage than he would usually be able to, and put off the effects of 
          the damage until later. Would probably give something like a 25% boost 
          to HPs for a fixed period of time, after which those HPs would be lost, 
          possibly causing death.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Charge</b>: A warrior-type character could use 
          this attack if they were mounted. It could only be used to initiate 
          combat, and it would cause damage comparable to "backstab".</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Two-handed Weapons and/or Polearm Skills</b>: 
          A two-handed weapon would do more damage than a single weapon, but less 
          damage than two weapons dual-wielded. Weapons flagged as "two-handed" 
          could finally break that +10 DR limit and provide variety.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main"><b>Shield Block Skill</b>: Similar to parry, but 
          performed with a shield. A person holding a shield could use this skill 
          to block weapons, missiles, etc.</p>

        <p class="HeadB"><a name="VIRTSPACE"></a>Virtual Space</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Originally mailed around sometime in the summer of 
          1998.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">I actually had an interesting discussion with someone 
          on rimm today about rooms with "virtual space"... Apparently 
          he already has something similar to what I was thinking of working on 
          his MUD, although only in 2 dimensions. My "grand idea" involves 
          3 dimensions or axis; X,Y,Z.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">My basic idea is this; Builders would be able to 
          flag certain rooms as "expanded". Much like a "tunnel" 
          flag, an "expanded" flag would bring some new setable values 
          into a room, values of width (X), length (Y), and height (Z). For simplicity 
          sake, each coordinate"box" would be considered to be 10'x10'x10'. 
          So if you wished to convey a larger room, say a throne room, you could 
          set the "expanded" flag, and set the X &amp; Y values to say 
          3 &amp; 5 ... This would mean that your "Throne Room" is now 
          30' wide by 50' long by 10' high. Now, to locate a player, mob, object 
          within this room would require a 3-d array; Players could be located 
          within the array at say (1000:2,3,0) or (vnum:X,Y,Z).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">A graphical representation of this room would be;</p>
        <table width="600" border="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody><tr> 
            <td width="150"><img src="./Herne's SMAUG Building Pages - Herne's Silly Ideas_files/virt_pic01.gif" width="150" height="150"> 
            </td>
            <td width="450" class="Text_Main" valign="top">A coordinate of (2,3,0) 
              would place the player (P) in the middle of the room. Positions 
              of mobs or objs could be compared to the position of the player 
              and the player could be given information like; Mob (M) is northwest 
              of you, or Object (O) is south of you.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p class="Text_Main"> Description-wise, the overall description of the 
          room would be the same for the WHOLE room, with some minor exceptions. 
          Extra room edits could be keyed to show up when the Player was on a 
          specific coordinate, or if the player looked in a specific direction. 
          Perhaps someone who was "config +brief" would see only these 
          specific "coordinate keyed" desc's, something like "Throne 
          Room. There is a door in the wall to your right." and it would 
          only be seen when you're standing at (3,3,0) or if you looked toward 
          (3,3,0) from another coordinate Say from (2,3,0) you looked northeast, 
          you'd see "A door in the middle of east wall".</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">As for exits, you could link exits from one room 
          to another room and specify a coordinate for the exit to link to. IE: 
          Say you wanted to link an exit from room 1001 to room 1000, but you 
          want the exit to be in the middle of this expanded room. You'd stand 
          in room 1001 and type "redit bexit w 1000:3,3,0" and a Player 
          leaving west from room 1001 would find themselves in the middle of east 
          wall of room 1000.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">To display it in graphic form:</p>
        <table width="600" border="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody><tr> 
            <td width="150" valign="top"><img src="./Herne's SMAUG Building Pages - Herne's Silly Ideas_files/virt_pic02.gif" width="150" height="150"></td>
            <td width="450" valign="top" class="Text_Main">In this example, room 
              1001 is displayed as being an expanded room of 30' x 30', but it 
              doesn't have to be, it could just be a normal room with no special 
              flags. Adding "virtualspace" to rooms gives a more logical 
              layout to the map of an area. Sometimes it's hard for people to 
              realize that room A may be bigger than room B, and when they're 
              trying to map, they want to know why if they go 3 "rooms" 
              N and 2 "rooms" E why they don't end up at room B.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p class="Text_Main"> To take this a step further, we can go into 3 dimensions. 
          Say room 1000 is part of a street, and this section of street runs 30' 
          wide x 50' long x 30' high. Now you can add MORE interesting things 
          because people who are flying are free to rise above the street level 
          and yet be in the same "Room" as their buddy who's standing 
          on the street below. And say this street has a 2-story house on the 
          east side of it, now you could fly or climb up to the 2nd story window 
          from the street!</p>
        <table width="600" border="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody><tr> 
            <td width="150" valign="top"><img src="./Herne's SMAUG Building Pages - Herne's Silly Ideas_files/virt_pic03.gif" width="150" height="150"></td>
            <td width="450" class="Text_Main" valign="top">OK, visualizing, the 
              big oblong is room 1000, you'd need 1 description for this room, 
              plus "spot descriptions" for the windows (open squares 
              with dots) on the first floor of the house, and the door (solid 
              square). The 6 smaller boxes would be normal rooms of 1 vnum each, 
              linked the old way... </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p class="Text_Main">Now, you'd have to generate some code for line-of-sight; 
          A player standing in the doorway of the house looking west would be 
          able to see the whole of room 1000 and anything on it, but a player 
          standing in at the far ends of the east side of room 1000 might not 
          be able to see someone standing in the doorway. Similarly, someone standing 
          in the doorway might not be able to see someone on the wall OVER the 
          doorway unless they stepped outside and looked up. And if you wanted 
          to get really fancy, you might make it so that large objects in the 
          expanded room could actually obscure a player's line-of-sight if someone 
          was standing directly behind the object. In the same vein, race may 
          affect what a player can and can't see because they simply can't clearly 
          see the end of the room (ie: You see someone far to the north of you).</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Now let's fly up 10' from (1000:2,3,0) to (1000:2,3,1)</p>
        <table width="600" border="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody><tr>

            <td width="450" class="Text_Main">Now we're still in room 1000, but 
              we're looking at the second story of the house to the east rather 
              than the first story. People who're flying could actually be above 
              those people/mobs below them, perhaps even out of range from attack 
              unless the person was say directly below them (being able to jump 
              up and swing at them) or they had a ranged-type of weapon (projectile 
              weapons, maybe some spells like magic missile or fireball?). Also, 
              those with a climb skill may be able to scale the wall of the house, 
              but they'd be limited to movement within the coordinates that the 
              house actually touches (in this case; {3,2,1}, {3,3,1} &amp; {3,4,1})</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p class="Text_Main">If you go up 10' more, to the limit of room 1000 
          (remember it's only 30' high), we're up at the roof height of the house, 
          there are no rooms for us to access there, so looking east we'd only 
          see "The roof of the house" or whatever coordinate linked 
          ed was there. Up at this height, 30' above the street, dropped objects 
          could become missile weapons, those below you wouldn't be able to attack 
          you without a ranged weapon and falling from this height (if your spell 
          wore off) would cause actual damage.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Now, what would the player see? Let's assume the 
          player is standing at ground level on the east side of room 1000, a 
          player with "config +brief" might see something like this;</p>

          a 2-story house with windows in the second story and think to yourself
