        <p class="HeadC" align="left"><a name="PART1"></a>If You Build It…</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Area creation is arguably the most difficult part 
          in the process of building your MUD. The game, the MUD itself, is built 
          on the areas it contains and those areas will separate what is considered 
          a "good" MUD to everything else. Players and code base, while 
          important to the "feel" of the MUD aren't very useful without 
          a "world" to play in, therefore MUDs must strive to make better 
          places to explore.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Many people will describe themselves as "Builders," 
          however that title applies to very few people. Anyone can slap together 
          a text file and call it an area, but only those who take the time to 
          provide a "descriptive realism" to flesh out an area can truly 
          call themselves as a (capital—B) "Builder." If you're 
          one of those people who sees a room description as unimportant or something 
          to ignore, but will spend countless hours perfecting the perfect mob 
          program or create objects with massive hit point gains and damage modifiers, 
          then perhaps you are not a Builder. This does not mean what you do is 
          not important to the MUD you work for, everything someone does to further 
          the MUD environment is important; from building, to coding, to playing.</p>
          <p align="right"><a href="http://www.realmsofdespair.com/smaug/herne/smaug/mech-build.html#TOP"><img src="./Herne's SMAUG Building Pages - The Mechanics of Building_files/sml-top.gif" width="75" height="25" alt="[Back to Top]" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART2"></a>Builders and Building</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">It is easy to describe a bad builder. A bad builder 
          will create an area on the fly from a block of vnumbers, using two or 
          three sentence room descriptions at best. Room exits will be made randomly 
          depending on what that builder had on his or her mind at the time. Flags 
          will be minimal unless they have something specific to do with the mob, 
          or this is a special room that they require for a specific mob. Exit 
          descriptions will be nonexistent, as will extra room descriptions (or 
          "eds"). Mobiles in these types of areas tend to be huge by 
          most MUD standards, with massive hit points, many attacks, and large 
          damage, or they may be classed as "leveling mobs" with mediocre 
          HPs and damage. Mob descriptions, if any, will be short one-line affairs. 
          Objects in these sorts of areas tend to lean towards large weapons or 
          heavy armour.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Generally, the reason most people are considered 
          "bad builders" is because they often come at area building 
          from the wrong direction. When creating an area, your foremost thoughts 
          should not be on the size of the Mobs, nor should they be on the strength 
          or power of the objects you create, they should be about theme, the 
          atmosphere you're creating and congruence with the rest of the MUD. 
          Many people also use the opportunity of building to "get back" 
          at all those nasty equipment-laden Avatars who really need to get a 
          good beating, or to try to fill a weapon or equipment niche that they 
          feel needs to be filled, often unbalancing the game with overpowered 
          items. Nobody wants a player-mangling, DT-strewn, killing field of an 
          area, nor does anyone want a gawd-slaying sword with a +37 DR and 600 
          HPs attached to it. Players might think they do, but things would get 
          extremely boring very quickly if this were the norm.</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.realmsofdespair.com/smaug/herne/smaug/mech-build.html#TOP"><img src="./Herne's SMAUG Building Pages - The Mechanics of Building_files/sml-top.gif" width="75" height="25" alt="[Back to Top]" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART3"></a>Getting Started</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">A good builder's best tool is their brain. Before 
          starting an area, be sure that your brain is present and fully engaged. 
          The next thing you'll want to do is turn off your computer — A 
          good area is not created by sitting around in OLC-mode whacking at keys 
          until something comes to you, a good area is planned from the beginning.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The first thing you'll want to do is decide what 
          your area is going to be about — Are you making the castle fortress 
          of the Hill Giant named Fred, or Dread Pirate Jim's island hideaway, 
          or perhaps a Dwarven city buried deep inside a boxwood hedge. Your area 
          needs an overshadowing theme. Everything about your area should be based 
          upon this theme, from mobs to rooms to objects; everything should reflect 
          the theme. If you're in a giant's fortress, everything will probably 
          be huge, and if you're in a boxwood hedge then there will probably be 
          all sorts of objects made of wood or something organic. </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">To use an analogy; if your area was a tree, your 
          area's theme would be the trunk, and everything else would hang off 
          of it — rooms would be branches, mobs and objects would be twigs, 
          programs and descriptions would be the leaves that "fleshed" 
          your area out.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Once you have your theme decided upon, you'll want 
          to think of the purpose of the area, in other words, why do players 
          want to explore this area? Theme and purpose often work hand in hand, 
          however they don't necessarily need to. For most areas, the purpose 
          is to accomplish a main goal; defeat the Giant, capture the Pirate, 
          or steal the Dwarven king's golden beard comb. Often, areas are built 
          merely for the joy of exploration and their only goal is to give the 
          players the experience they need to make the next level, or perhaps 
          an area is made to link one large area to another. These are all quite 
          valid and necessary purposes for an area.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Now that you have a theme and purpose in mind your 
          next step in the process would be the planning. Planning what? </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="Text_Main">What sorts of "rooms" will be in your 
            area and an estimate of their numbers. Will you have a village? Will 
            this village have single rooms for each building, or multiple rooms? 
            Will there be an Inn? How large will it be? Try to estimate how many 
            rooms or vnums you'll need to complete your area, if in doubt, think 
            big. As a rough guide; A small leveling area for low-level players 
            or a "transition area" (an area intended to link other major 
            areas and give the feeling of space) will have about 50 rooms, a mid-level 
            area will have about 100 rooms on average, and a large area intended 
            for mid to high-level players will have 150-200+ rooms. Keep in mind 
            that this is a very rough guide.</li>
		</ul><ul>
          <li class="Text_Main">What kinds of "mobiles" or people will 
            be in your area. Based on your themes and goal(s), you will probably 
            have one of more "boss" mobs, Fred the Giant, for example 
            as well as several support mobs (Fred's henchmen, guards) and "atmosphere" 
            mobs (Fred's maid or cook). You may have several levels of support 
            or boss mobs scattered about the area leading up to a central figure, 
            or you may have no central figure at all. Atmosphere mobs can be added 
            on the fly as you require them and often provide amusement while playing 
            a large part in the general feel of the area.</li>
			</ul><ul>
          <li class="Text_Main">What mixture of objects players will be likely 
            to find in your area. Be sure to keep your objects within the theme 
            of your area — if your area is a farm, you're likely to find 
            pitchforks and rakes rather than swords and trebuchets, etc. Generally, 
            the number of objects you can have in your area will be limited by 
            the number of rooms that you have as most MUDs will assign vnums for 
            rooms, objects and mobs in the same block amounts. Don't be afraid 
            to dress up some of your mobs in clothing, or flesh out some of the 
            rooms with items of interest or value if you have extra object numbers.</li>
        </ul>
      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.realmsofdespair.com/smaug/herne/smaug/mech-build.html#TOP"><img src="./Herne's SMAUG Building Pages - The Mechanics of Building_files/sml-top.gif" width="75" height="25" alt="[Back to Top]" border="0"></a></p>
        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART4"></a>Building Logistics</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">So let's say we're building a Pirate Island, what 
          do we need next? Well, foremost you'll want to familiarize yourself 
          on the subject of pirates; what they do, what sorts of clothing or equipment 
          they'd tend to have, they're mannerisms, their codes of conduct, etc. 
          Then, assuming you're working in a medieval or pre-gunpowder type setting, 
          you'll probably want to pick up some reference-type books. Read up on 
          sailing vessels and learn about what sorts of ships pirates would use 
          and why. Learn the lingo. Build yourself a glossary of words associated 
          with privateers or pirates, their ships, their weapons, their clothing 
          and other equipment so you're able to describe what players are seeing 
          and equip your mobs as accurately as you can. 
          Don't be afraid to write things down, make notes, or keep a small journal 
          (either electronically or on paper) of things you find.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Most players will not sit and read every room description, 
          some will. Write for those people who are willing to read. When you're 
          talking about a specific item, say a lamp, describe it accurately — 
          A ship's lamp would probably be made of something that wouldn't oxidize 
          in the salt air and be mounted in a gimbals so that it moves with the 
          rolling of the ship. An accurate description helps to bring your "world" 
          alive in the minds of the players. Think of each room description as 
          part of a story. Each room you write is a chapter in that story, each 
          room furthers the plot, and every room builds on the "whole" 
          of the area. Every room, mobile, or object should reflect your theme 
          and continue the framework of your area. </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Imagine you're describing the room or place you're 
          sitting in right now to someone who is blind, or someone who is from 
          another culture. Perhaps this person has never seen a light switch, 
          a wristwatch or a table lamp, and has no clue as to their function. 
          This person is likely to want to give these items a more detailed examination, 
          and this is where you would want to focus your room's eds or extra descriptions. 
          These eds are the perfect place to give the more curious players insightful 
          information about the area, or clues to the room's secrets (hidden doors, 
          objects, etc). If your room describes a peculiar style of writing desk, 
          then be sure to add an extra description for that desk — Perhaps 
          through searching for more information about that desk, players might 
          gain insight on how to defeat the "boss mob" for your area. 
          Particularly special items may warrant the use of a room object (an 
          object that sits in the room), something that stays in that room and 
          draws attention to itself by being obvious. (A large mahogany desk dominates 
          the center of the room.)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Reward those players who are willing to stop and 
          read through your descriptions and make inferences. Someone may even 
          learn something new (maybe even you).</p>

        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART5"></a>Layout and Planning</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">So now you have your theme, and you've familiarized 
          yourself with the specifics of your theme. What next?</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Now you'll want to start laying out or mapping your 
          area. Most Builders will have a specific goal in mind when they create 
          an area — Find the green key, open the blue door, kill the big 
          mob and you gain the big weapon. </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Mapping is a key step in the building process, and 
          while your base map can be added to or altered as the area progresses, 
          it should remain a primary step in building your area. A map will provide 
          you with a visual representation of what you have in mind, with directional 
          references to other areas or other parts of your area. It also provides 
          important information as to the number of rooms you will require to 
          start constructing your area and how many rooms you have left to work 
          with as you progress through your building process. You may even want 
          to sketch out feature items (Examples; a sunken ship, a castle, a fallen 
          tree) of your area on the map so that you remember to provide visual 
          clues in the room descriptions. (IE: Does that fallen tree pass through 
          2 rooms or 3? Does it block progress in a specific direction? Can players 
          climb over it?)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Maps can be as simple or as detailed as you wish 
          to make them — you might use squares or circles to represent each 
          room vnum with arrows representing exits, or you might decide to use 
          a program like Excel to keep track of each room and its exits. However 
          you decide to map your map, it should be clear, legible and able to 
          provide you with an instant reference to the layout of your area. </p>

              <p class="Text_Main">Here is an example of a simple map that clearly

                creek, a fallen tree, and a large hill.</p>
              <p class="Text_Main">Once you've decided on the basic "look" 
                of the landscape, you can go back and overlay the map with your 
                room vnumbers. For this example, I've used little boxes to represent 
                each "room" or "view" that I want to translate 
                into a vnum. Each box need not be the same size (although they 
                are in the example), the size of each room is relative to the 
                description that you're making — You may wish to use one 
                vnum to represent 4 miles of road, or one vnum to represent a 
                room in a house. The "scale" of the vnumber usually 
                depends on your intent or the content you're describing.</p>

        <p>From this example we can be quite certain that 
                room 1003 has the trunk of a fallen tree passing through it, and 
                the direction in which the trunk is laying is readily interpreted. 
                Room 1009 is on a hillside, and we can easily read how steep the 
                climb might be for those passing through the room. As well, we 
                can see that Room 1008 is in the middle of a creek and players 
                may or may not need some means of travelling through water to

        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART6"></a>Linear Vs. Nonlinear Layout of Areas</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Due to the nature of MUDs, areas tend to be linear 
          in nature (travel is from A to B to C), but they don't need to be. In 
          fact, a superior Builder will design areas that can be approached from 
          several directions, and mesh into similar areas or transitions zones 
          with ease. Nonlinear areas tend to be more interesting and can provide 
          much entertainment without getting oneself too deeply into trouble. 
          Such areas can provide several lesser "boss mobs" in place 
          of the usual "ultimate goal" mob, or allow players to work 
          a progression of more difficult mobs until they are ready to attempt 
          a very large mob.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Here are some graphical representations of linear 
          and nonlinear area layouts.</p>

              along assigned pathways through the various challenges from A through 
              C along one and only one pathway. One cannot travel from A to C 
              without first passing through B, and neither can one return from

              the first task to be accomplished in this example). Players are

              difficult levels of the area until they eventually reach the final 
              task at C. In this example, players are only allowed to move about

              the freedom of movement to pass from lesser tasks to harder tasks

              more difficult tasks through just about any pathway they can find 
              until they reach the final goal. In this example, players move up 
              and down through different tasks without really knowing that they 
              are entering easier or more difficult levels as they move. This 
              method of linear planning tends to give a better "feeling" 
              to an area — tasks aren't "chunked" into rigidly 
              defined levels which provides a sense of free movement. This sort 
              of area also allows for easier placement within the MUD "world"

          the more advanced Builder toward the construction of mega-areas. "Mega-areas" 
          being larger areas (say 500 rooms and up) comprising several smaller 
          areas, all based on the same major theme or "background story," 
          and inter-linked and dependent on one another to function properly.

        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART7"></a>Writing the Area</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">You've researched, you've mapped, and you're reasonably 
          sure how many vnumbers you want to use to make your area, so now you're 
          ready to start building — What to do first?</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">First, turn off your computer and take up a pad and 
          paper.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Yes, that's right, low-tech is the best way to start 
          building a really good area. Get yourself some ruled paper, or a journal, 
          and a pen and start scribbling. Journals or small ring-bound notebooks 
          lend themselves to writing better than your basic three-hole punch paper 
          as journals tend to travel better. Area building can happen just about 
          anywhere where you can sit down and write, but first remind yourself 
          that room descriptions are limited to 24 lines of 75 characters (approximately) 
          each. This doesn't mean that you need to limit yourself to small, cramped 
          paragraphs of text, it just means that if you wish to describe something, 
          (say a painting on a wall) in detail, you will need to use eds or edits. 
          Players who take the time to read your descriptions with care will come 
          across these more interesting tidbits of information, perhaps to their 
          benefit. Write whenever and wherever you can, and don't limit yourself 
          to 1800 characters for each room, go nuts! You can make editorial changes 
          later on.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">When I started building, I used a small text-only 
          editor set to wrap lines at 75 characters and made small text files 
          for each room (1000.txt, 1001.txt, etc) from my handwritten notes. After 
          a while, I was able to graduate up to a better text-editing program 
          that included a spell checker and a thesaurus, and life became easier 
          — A thesaurus can be your best friend. Then, once I had the bulk 
          of the area done, I used my MUD client to send these text files to the 
          MUD, one line at a time. (A program like ZMUD will do this, just make 
          sure you have a hard return at the end of each 75-character line, and 
          add a short delay between sending one line and the next — You should 
          be able to set up these sorts of options in the ZMUD preferences. Otherwise, 
          cut and paste works just as easily, but it takes a bit longer. Also, 
          if you add "redit desc" as your first line, and "/s" 
          as your last line, your text file can automatically open and close the 
          editing buffer for you.)</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The best way to begin writing is to have your map 
          in front of you, and picture yourself in the "room" (vnum) 
          that you're describing. Pretend you're standing in the centre of the 
          room and describe what you see around you — imagine you're describing 
          it to someone in a letter, or to someone who can't see where you are. 
          Be as descriptive as you possibly can, and use your thesaurus!</p>

        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART8"></a>Things to Avoid:</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Some MUD Building Councils refuse to accept areas 
          where the word "you" is used in the room descriptions, but 
          I feel this is a bit of overkill myself. There are exceptions to this 
          rule, however; </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">A room description should never say something like, 
          "You feel scared." — This is one of the major blunders 
          of building. What if the content of the room isn't scary to the player? 
          What scares one player may not even phase another. Never tell a player 
          how they are supposed to be feeling, use the room description to tell 
          them what they're seeing, and let them draw their own conclusions as 
          to how they should act or feel. </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Don't give them any information about the room which 
          isn't blatantly obvious. You may want to tell a player "You smell 
          smoke." — This is generally acceptable as we assume that all 
          players have a sense of smell. Likewise, you may use something like 
          "You hear a bird singing," as we assume that most players 
          will have a sense of hearing — This wouldn't be true for room that 
          is flagged as "silent," however, so you'd need to be careful 
          with that. If something isn't openly obvious, you may want to add some 
          sort of hint to the room description to tempt players to examine the 
          room more closely — the addition of descriptive eds help in this 
          case.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Room descriptions should never mention the mobile 
          in the room — "Geoff, the shopkeeper, polishes his wares…" 
          Well what happens when Geoff is dead or not in the room? A Mobile's 
          long description is what you see when you enter the room — let 
          the mobile speak for itself. How do we know this is Geoff's store anyway? 
          Is the room name "Geoff's Store"? If not, then we have no 
          idea who this guy Geoff is, so let him speak for himself. Also remember 
          to fill in Geoff's description so that when a player looks at the mob, 
          they know what or who they're looking at. Room descriptions should only 
          describe the room. Mob descriptions should only describe the mob. Object 
          descriptions should only describe the object. </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">"You are Falling!" — How do you know 
          the player is falling? The player could be a pixie, or some other winged 
          species that is constantly flying around, so they wouldn't be falling 
          at all. If you wish to use a phrase like "You are falling!" 
          first use a room program to check to see if your victim is flying or 
          floating and then mpecho at the non-flying creature that they are falling. 
          There are few exceptions to this rule however, such as when some sort 
          of magical force prevents a creature from flying, or perhaps a strong 
          wind keeps a flying creature grounded. These sorts of situations would 
          need to be immediately presented to the player, presumably with a room 
          program (anyone who scried into the room could read the description), 
          as they enter the room. IE; "A strong wind whistles through the 
          cave, shoving you into a deep hole! You are falling!." Etc.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">"Over to the left you see…" — 
          This is a common enough mistake for many builders, especially if you're 
          making a linear area with one predefined path A to B to C (See Figure 
          1 above). Never assume that the player's left is west — a player 
          may not be facing north when they enter the room, they could be going 
          in any direction so don't build your descriptions to read in only one 
          direction. If something is on the west wall, state that it is on the 
          west wall and not "to the right". For simplicity sake, we 
          assume that all players are born with a compass built into their heads 
          and they are able to differentiate north from south. Also, try not to 
          fall into the trap of describing every room like you're reading a shopping 
          list of compass directions — "To the north you see… And 
          to the west you see… And to the east you see…" These 
          sorts of room descriptions can get pretty boring in the long run.</p>

        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART9"></a>Things to Include:</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Specific objects, such as large items of furniture 
          or perhaps a sign post, that are mentioned in the room description may 
          be better described if you make them into their own object. For example; 
          let's say you're in the throne room of a large castle and you want to 
          emphasize the fact that the throne is particularly ornate or maybe there 
          is an important clue to the area associated with it — this would 
          be a perfect opportunity to make yourself an object for the room. If 
          a player has his display preferences set to "brief," then 
          he will fail to notice anything specific mentioned in the room description 
          (unless they type "look"), so if you want your throne to be 
          noticed make it into an object and put the description(s) of the throne 
          on that object. Then the player will be sure to notice it.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Atmosphere is everything. If your player is stepping 
          from dry land into a creek, then you may want to add a room program 
          that says something like "Splash! You're in the creek." But 
          you need to be careful of a number of things if you do this; Primarily, 
          is your victim flying? Also, try to avoid "spammy" room programs 
          that fire off every time someone enters into the room — If you 
          have 4 people travelling in a group, your program is going to fire 4 
          times, so make sure you're using "mpechoat" to send the message 
          each player individually. Atmosphere also includes things like; The 
          sorts of noises you might hear if you're walking through a forest, ie; 
          croaking frogs, singing crickets, etc. If you're in a town, you might 
          hear sounds of merchants yelling about their wares, the clinking of 
          glassware as you wander by a pub, or the ring of a hammer and anvil 
          near the blacksmith's shop. Atmosphere "sounds" can be accomplished 
          by using various room programs with mpechoat, mpecho, and mpasound.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Descriptions for large areas of the same sorts of 
          terrain, such as a forest or swamp, are often difficult and tedious. 
          Avoid using the same description over and over for 20 rooms; instead 
          try making one long description to describe the of the "forest" 
          as a whole unit, this may give you 25 lines of text, and then use bits 
          and pieces of this description in each room. Move the lines around a 
          bit, add some new words here and there, make the whole thing more interesting 
          to read — if you use one big description and then chop it up, it 
          is easier than trying to write a new description for each room. The 
          only exception to reusing descriptions would be in a maze, but even 
          so, try to use a variety of descriptions throughout your maze, each 
          based on the same "base" description.</p>

        <p class="HeadC"><a name="PART10"></a>Conclusions</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">The mechanics of building, in itself, isn't difficult 
          once you learn the various commands you need to open and close the editing 
          tools. The difficulties arise when someone with little or no imagination, 
          who'd rather not spend a whole lot of effort, starts running off areas 
          and calling himself a "builder." Anyone can "build," 
          but then anyone can construct a house too — the differences show 
          up in the quality of the workmanship. A Builder (capital-B) will research 
          and plan what he is going to build, a builder will not. This doesn't 
          mean that every area needs weeks and months of preparation and research, 
          but you should at least know what you are talking about when you start 
          using the lingo, and you should have some sort of broad plan (and a 
          map) in mind when writing.</p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Good Builders will also innovate new ways to do things, 
          either with words or mpprograms, or both. For example; Why does a shopkeeper 
          always need to be standing in his shop? Does he have no life outside 
          the shop? If the shop is closed, then there is no reason for the mob 
          to be standing there, so why not add some clever programs in that allow 
          the shopkeeper to lock up his shop and go home? What about guards — 
          Are they always guarding the same spot for 24 hours? Why not switch 
          the guards, change them around, or send some off duty and bring new 
          guards out? Areas need to live and breath, they shouldn't remain a static 
          thing. Move mobs around, close up shops, include mob social interaction 
          within your areas. Make your area feel more alive! </p>
        <p class="Text_Main">Building doesn't need to be a difficult thing — 
          Every area is a story, with each room you write telling a chapter of 
          that story. A good Builder is a good story teller.</p>
