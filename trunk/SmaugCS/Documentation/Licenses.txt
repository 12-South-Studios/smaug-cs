 *  The MUDprograms are heavily based on the original MOBprogram code that  *

 *  Much has been added, including the capability to put a "program" on     *
 *  rooms and objects, not to mention many more triggers and ifchecks, as   *
 *  well as "script" support.                                               *

 *  Error reporting has been changed to specify whether the offending       *

 * Name: Liquidtable Module (3.0b)
 * Author: John 'Noplex' Bellone (jbellone@comcast.net)
 * Terms:
 * If this file is to be re-disributed; you must send an email
 * to the author. All headers above the #include calls must be
 * kept intact. All license requirements must be met. License
 * can be found in the included license.txt document or on the
 * website.
 * Description:
 * This module is a rewrite of the original module which allowed for
 * a SMAUG mud to have a fully online editable liquidtable; adding liquids;
 * removing them; and editing them online. It allows an near-endless supply
 * of liquids for builder's to work with.
 * A second addition to this module allowed for builder's to create mixtures;
 * when two liquids were mixed together they would produce a different liquid.
 * Yet another adaptation to the above concept allowed for objects to be mixed
 * with liquids to produce a liquid.
 * This newest version offers a cleaner running code; smaller; and faster in
 * all ways around. Hopefully it'll knock out the old one ten fold ;)
 * Also in the upcoming 'testing' phase of this code; new additions will be added
 * including a better alchemey system for creating poitions as immortals; and as
 * mortals.
