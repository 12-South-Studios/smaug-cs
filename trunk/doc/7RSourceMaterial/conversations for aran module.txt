Attan Al'sha'if
<onClientEnter - 1st Time>
- Here we are, friend. The Inn of the Seven Planes. As we discussed on my ship, you will find whatever it is you are seeking in this place. I am grateful for your company on the long journey here and Light-willing we will meet again.
- continue
- Now, I have much to do back on the docks, on my ship, and within the Great Market, so I must be going. Take care of the books you have, they cost me a fair number of Kaeresian Lances before I set sail.
  - Where are you headed next?
    - Wind and gods permitting, I will be headed east as far as Neamora and Vezeve.
  - How long will you be in Dushara?
    - For another three days, at most. The sails need patching before we sail and I must replace some of my crew.
  - Where is your ship?
    - The docks on this side of the river, the pier closest to The Fortress.
  - Tell me of Dushara.
    - A great city, with nearly everything you could ever want at your fingertips. Watch your purse and your step while you are here, my friend.
  - Farewell
    - Good journeys, my friend. We shall meet again.

Liase Al'Verran
There isn't much to tell, I'm afraid.
- Where are you from?
- - I am originally from Kaeres to the north.
- - - What is Kaeres?
- - - - You have not heard of Kaeres? Where are you from again?
- - - - - Very well, <FirstName>. Kaeres is known as the Kingdom of the Cross. All aspects of life in Kaeres revolve around the worship of Maron. The Kingdom is ruled, unofficially, by the Albarian Knights.
- - - - - - Who are these Knights you speak of?
- - - - - - - The Albarian Knights are one of the most fearsome forces in Midalor. Powerful beyond measure, they fight the kingdom's battles and extend its influence. From what I hear they are fighting the Val'Atur in Deraka.
- - - Why did you leave?
- - - - Link to Statement below
- Why are you here?
- - There isn't much for a strong woman in Kaeres so I came here. Dushara is, afterall, the greatest city in the world.
- - - What do you mean?
- - - - Magic is not allowed in Kaeres, unless you serve the Church. And only men can serve Maron, according to those in power.
- - - Tell me about Dushara
- - - - There is so much to tell... Dushara is so huge and so busy that everyone comes here for everything. Others could tell you more, as I only arrived myself a few days ago.
- Why haven't you gone below into the crypts?
- - Um... Yes... Well, you see...
- - - continue
- - - - The truth of the matter is that I... um... I'm a little afraid of the dark... And of being alone...in the dark...
