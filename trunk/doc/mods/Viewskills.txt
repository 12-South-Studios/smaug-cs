Terms of Use
------------

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

This command will give you a simple listing of the skills a player
has and the percentages they have learned each skill to. If they aren't
online at the time, use the 'loadup' command to load their pfile.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Copy the following code into skills.c, or whichever file you prefer.

/* New command to view a player's skills - Samson 4-13-98 */
void do_viewskills( CHAR_DATA * ch, char *argument )
{
   char buf[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];
   CHAR_DATA *victim;
   int sn, col;

   if( !argument || argument[0] == '\0' )
   {
      send_to_char( "&zSyntax: skills <player>.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   if( !( victim = get_char_world( ch, argument ) ) )
   {
      send_to_char( "No such person in the game.\r\n", ch );
      return;
   }

   col = 0;

   if( !IS_NPC( victim ) )
   {
      set_char_color( AT_MAGIC, ch );
      for( sn = 0; sn < top_sn && skill_table[sn] && skill_table[sn]->name; sn++ )
      {
         if( skill_table[sn]->name == NULL )
            break;
         if( victim->pcdata->learned[sn] == 0 )
            continue;

         snprintf( buf, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "%20s %3d%% ", skill_table[sn]->name, victim->pcdata->learned[sn] );
         send_to_char( buf, ch );

         if( ++col % 3 == 0 )
            send_to_char( "\r\n", ch );
      }
   }
   return;
}

2. Add the appropriate entries to mud.h and tables.c for do_viewskills.

3. Make clean, and recompile.

4. Add a 'viewskills' command.
