#summary SmaugCS MUD 0.1 Alpha
#sidebar SideBarTableOfContents

Based on SmaugFUSS 1.9 which was obtained from Nick Gammon's website (http://www.mushclient.com/downloads/dlsmaug.htm).

The goals of this project are:
 * Make the SmaugFUSS code easier to maintain for non-C developers
 * Organize and clean-up much of the codebase
 * Replaced out-dated code (list and string handling in particular) with .NET Library code or extensions
 * Replaced out-dated #defines and structs with class objects and enums
 * Use Windows sockets instead of the existing network layer
 * Replace file-handling with a more robust file handling system
 * Lastly, get the code back into working (and running) order

Project Information:
 * Developed using C# .NET 4.0
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
