You look apon this wounded and and limping church guard, and sigh.
Knowing full well the same fate may await you if you continue on.
You see a troll hide sticking out of his backpack, so thats what he has
fought lately...ahhh you smile, been there done that, even have the scars.
The knight is well armored but appears tired and somewhat older then he
should be. His face is lined with the lines only age can bring yet his
eye's say he is much younger. There is a large glowing holy symbol apon
his breast plate that depicts a huge griffon holding a lilly in its talon's.

Brown Troll~
Brown Troll
~
You see a small brown troll advancing towards you!
The creature is covered in warts and blisters that
seep out a puss and sickly blue colored liquid.
The troll is wearing little in the way of armor,
only small bits and pieces it must have gathered during
fights with past adventurers. Armed with only its claws
this troll still advances towards you.
The troll grins as it watches you draw your weapon,
then it smiles and cuts into its own wrist only to
have it heal seconds later! With a snarl it attacks!

a well learned barbarian who's name is still known in some

His name you recall not, but some say should you say his name
to his face he will recall his history and give gifts to them
who asssist in this. His family misses him as he misses them.

A dark lonely trail~
You stand along a dark lonely stretch of trail. There is no sounds coming
from anywhere near by. In fact its a little too quiet. You cast about
you in search of some sort of life or animals. But alas all you see is the
poor wounded church man before you. He sits here helping those who go into
the troll caves in search of fame and fortune.

Dark Pit~
You stand before a huge dank and dark pit. You hear the vague sounds
of claws scraping and bones crunching from within the pit. With a chill
in the air around you, you find yourself feeling most unwelcome here.
The walls are moist and soft to the touch, you wonder how stable this
area really is, and think it might be a bad idea to get stuck down there.

There is a large door leading east from here and of course you can always
go back up the way ya came. You mutter something vile, and kick the corpse
halfway across the room. Then look about you for some way out other then
back up. There appears to be a draft coming from somewhere to the east.

smooth to the touch. You thank your god that you are strong enough to be
able to stand here without getting blown through these tunnels and ending
up smashed to pieces on some wall somewhere.

warrior who has met his fate at the hands of the trolls of these caves.
A sign is here warning to go no further by order of the King of Dark Haven.

There is a dark gloomy stair way leading deeper into the outter
troll caves. You can make out movement down below and you shudder to
think what new horors await you here.
You can hear the sounds of water and waves near by.

south west. You shudder when you see some huge webs spun around the
stalage-tites here. You wonder just where the spiders are that made those.
Better yet you hope you don't run into them.

You find yourself standing in a huge chamber that is barely lit
by your torch. You scan about you and gasp in wonder as you see a
huge silver statue of a Troll standing before a huge set of silver
doors. The Troll's eye's seem to follow your every move, a deep chill
sets in and you shiver as your eye's make contact with the statues.
The chamber is filled with dust and there appears to be no tracks here
at all. The statue is devoid of dust and as is the doors. There
are some glowing gliphs and sigil's apon it that radiate evil.

you hope you can actually leave the area from here, your attempts in
the other rooms was useless, now here outside the magic field of the
tomb you hope for one last chance. If only you can defeat the guardian
of this portal. You know better then to try to use the portal, so
you at least hope when its guardian is dead you can recall out.
